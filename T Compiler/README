This directory contains the source code for a compiler for the T language.

The compiler reads a T program from stdin. And it writes a dump
of the AST for the program (after semantic analysis) to stderr. The
AST is dumped in prefix form, one AST node per line.

To build the compiler: make

To run the compiler: ./tc <input.t >output.s

To assemble and link the output of the compiler: gcc output.s RTS.c

To build a stand-alone version of the scanner: make lexdbg

To run the stand-alone scanner: lexdbg <input.t

The stand-alone scanner will read the input program from stdin and
will write the tokens to stdout, one per line.
